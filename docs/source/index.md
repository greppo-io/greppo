## Welcome to Greppo's documentation

**Greppo** is a Python library that makes it easy for Data Scientists to quickly build geo-spatial apps natively in Python. You do not need any fonr-end or back-end experience to start using this. Out-of-the-box, the library provides front-end components and APIs to connect to the back-end.

**Greppo** focuses on:

1. Optimizing for simple and fast UX. A user-experience that anyone with simple knowledge of python can use.
2. Rich UI features. The components provide minimal, interactive and beautiful visualization interfaces.
3. Readily provides APIs. Connection to the UI elements to your python script are taken care out-of-the-box.
