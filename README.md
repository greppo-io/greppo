**A Python framework for building geospatial web-applications.**

Greppo is an open-source Python framework that makes it easy to build applications. It provides a toolkit to quickly integrate data, algorithms, visualizations and UI for interactivity.

## Installation

```shell
$ pip install greppo
```

We suggest you use a virtual environment to manage your packages for this project. For more infromation and troubleshooting visit the [Installation Guide](https://docs.greppo.io).

**Windows users**: Installation of Fiona (one of Greppo's dependencies) on Windows machines usually doesn't work by default. A manual installation with e.g. [wheel files by Christoph Gohlke](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)  would be a work around.

## A simple example

```python
# inside app.py

from greppo import app
import geopandas as gpd

data_gdf = gpd.read_file("geospatial_data.geojson")

buildings_gdf = gpd.read_file("./data/buildings.geojson")

app.overlay_layer(
    buildings_gdf,
    name="Buildings",
    description="Buildings in a neighbourhood in Amsterdam",
    style={"fillColor": "#F87979"},
    visible=True,
)

app.base_layer(
    name="Open Street Map",
    visible=True,
    url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
    subdomains=None,
    attribution='&copy; <a target="_blank" href="http://osm.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors',
)
```

Then run the aplication using the `greppo` cli command:

```shell
greppo serve app.py
```

To view the app that is being served, enter this address of the localhost `localhost:8080/` in your web browser. (Note: the port of `8080` might be different depending on other programs you're running. Check the port indicated in the command line interface.)

## Under the hood

Greppo is open-source and is built on open-source. Under the hood it uses [Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette), [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet), [ChartJS](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js), [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) to name a few. A detailed list of the open-source projects used is listed [here](https://docs.greppo.io/under-the-hood.html).

Greppo is our contribution back to the geospatial community. We want to make the development of geosaptial apps easy, to make it easy for data-scientists to showcase their work.
